            <h3>Hello, I'm an upcoming Frontend Engineer!</h3>
            <p>
                    I am an upcoming Computer Science graduate with a drive for building
                    user-friendly, and interactive websites and applications. The start
                    of my computer science journey started with my father using his computer
                    everyday. It led me to explore the wonders of tech and eventually encountering
                    the internet where it led my curiosity to understanding the web. I 
                    am always fond of collaboration especially working in teams and I am
                    eager to bring my expertise and knowledge to the team at Gugil.Co
